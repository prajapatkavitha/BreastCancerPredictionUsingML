# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model to predict breast cancer. The model classifies tumors as either malignant or benign based on a dataset of features.

## Project Structure

* `breast-cancer-data.csv`: The primary dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

* `BreastCancerPrediction`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

* `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries, which are typically pre-installed in a Google Colab environment:

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Open the `BreastCancerPrediction` Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.**
2.  **Upload the `breast-cancer-data.csv` file** to your Colab environment.
3.  **Run the cells sequentially** to execute the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** The `breast-cancer-data.csv` file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Initial data exploration is performed to understand its structure and features.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned, and any missing values are handled (e.g., using imputation). The features are then scaled to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
3.  **Model Training:** A machine learning classifier is selected and trained on the preprocessed data.
4.  **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using a test set, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to assess its effectiveness.
